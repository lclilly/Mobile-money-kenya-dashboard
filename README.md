Trends in Mobile Money in Kenya from 2007 to February 2025
Key Insights from my dashboard

The dashboard indicates a robust and consistent expansion in the mobile money sector in Kenya across various metrics from 2007 up to around 2023/2024.

Overall Growth Trajectory:

There's a clear and significant upward trend in the total value of agent cash in/cash out transactions from 2007 to roughly 2023-2024. Growth appears to accelerate notably after 2012.
Similarly, the number of registered mobile money accounts has experienced substantial and consistent growth over the same period (2007-2024).

Agent Network Expansion:

The number of yearly active agents has dramatically increased year over year, especially from 2008 up to 2024. This suggests a rapidly expanding accessibility and footprint of mobile money services across the country.
Transaction Dynamics (Volume vs. Value):

Both the volume (number of transactions) and the value (Ksh. Billions) of agent cash in/cash out transactions have shown strong, consistent growth from 2010 to 2024.
The line graph representing value appears to show a steeper increase in more recent years compared to the bars representing volume. This could suggest that the average transaction value has been increasing over time.
Recent Trends and Data Points (2024-2025):

For the "Agent Cash In/Cash Out Value Over Time" chart, there's a slight indication of a plateau or potential dip towards the very end of the timeline (around 2024).
In both the "Yearly Active Agents" and "Volume V/s Value" charts, the data point for 2025 appears significantly lower than 2024. This might indicate that the 2025 data is incomplete, a projection, or represents a partial period.

Summary:
My dashboard paints a picture of a thriving mobile money ecosystem in Kenya, characterized by:
>Sustained growth in transaction values and volumes.
>A continuously expanding user base (registered accounts).
>A rapidly growing network of active agents.
The potential plateau in transaction value towards 2024 and the nature of the 2025 data points might be areas for further investigation to understand if they represent emerging trends or data artifacts.
